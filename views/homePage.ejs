        <span class="introduction">My name is Juan Velazquez and I am a CS major at The
            University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley. I have been passionate for this field
            ever since taking an Intro to Computer Science course in High-school, inspiring me to
            continue growing my skills and having a better understanding of the engineering process.
